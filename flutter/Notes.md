The Xcode project defines build configurations: Debug, Release
Flutter expects a build configuration named Profile or similar.
Open Xcode to fix the problem:
  open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
1. Click on "Runner" in the project navigator.
2. Ensure the Runner PROJECT is selected, not the Runner TARGET.
3. Click the Editor->Add Configuration->Duplicate "Release" Configuration.

   If this option is disabled, it is likely you have the target selected instead
   of the project; see:
   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19842746/adding-a-build-configuration-in-xcode

   If you have created a completely custom set of build configurations,
   you can set the FLUTTER_BUILD_MODE=profile
   in the .xcconfig file for that configuration and run from Xcode.

4. If you are not using completely custom build configurations, name the newly created configuration profile.
